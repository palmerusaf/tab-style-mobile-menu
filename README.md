# tab-style-mobile-menu

## Description

- This is a simple JS function that creates a tab-style menu at the bottom of a website when the site is accessed on mobile.

## How to use

- This function takes two parameters in the form of array of DOM nodes for each argument.
- The first parameter is for menu items that will always be displayed as table ordered left to right.
- The second parameter is for menu items that will be hidden under a hamburger menu and will appear as the right most tab item of the menu bar.

## Motivations

The motivations behind this project are to practice creating commonly used JS web functions using standard JS and practicing publishing node packages.
